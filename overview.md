# Overview
This extension provides views that help to review data for both active and completed sprints. For the initial release, the extension provides a single **Sprint Review** view for reviewing the work items as of the last day of the sprint, including which work items moved in or out of the sprint after the sprint planning day.

This extension was build to supplement the built-in Azure DevOps views, which don't provide built-in views to help track sprint health. Additionally, organizations using SaFE suffer from lack of adequate visibility into work items that are moving in and out of the quarterly plan. 

# Support
While this extension is in development, it comes with no explicit support or warranties.
